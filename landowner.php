			<h2>Landowner Information</h2>

			<p>Rulon Enterprises consists of three partners &ndash; Ken, Roy, and Rodney &ndash; who currently farm 5,600 acres. While a large part of what we farm is family-owned, we also rent land from over 25 landowners. We work closely with each owner to fulfill his or her needs. It is important to know that we have over 25 different lease agreements, each modified to meet the specific needs of each farm.</p>

			<h3>Four Basic Objectives for Farms that We Manage</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>Maximize long-term net worth growth of the landowner</li>
				<li>Reduce or eliminate erosion through our no-till / cover crop system</li>
				<li>Build the soil&rsquo;s fertility and bio-life back to its most productive level</li>
				<li>Maximize your benefits from our business strengths: lower input costs, higher yields, and high prices received</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Custom Rental Agreements to Fit Landowner Needs</h3>

			<p>The two primary agreement types we use are:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Revenue share: Traditionally known as a crop share, our revenue share leases are designed to maximize net returns to the owner. In twenty-eight of the last thirty years, revenue share leases produced superior returns versus cash rent. One of the key advantages of a revenue share lease is our ability to share very high profits as they are earned. Cash rent leases always lag actual profits. In addition, we work closely with you and incorporate your input to help us achieve your goals.</li>
				<li>Cash rent: As the name implies, the owner receives a set amount each year. We negotiate this amount together, based on factors such as the land&rsquo;s productivity and current grain and input prices. While cash rents have increased dramatically over the last few years, they have failed to keep up with the gains of our revenue share leases.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Services we provide to landowners</h3>
